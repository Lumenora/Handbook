Circuit Launch Community Code

We are the Center for Hardware Development
and home to an intelligent, 
caring, and sharing community


1.	The single biggest benefit of Circuit Launch membership is access to your fellow members. We absolutely encourage you to make connections, collaborate, share ideas, provide advice, and generally make cool stuff happen. We encourage you to buy/sell goods and services from each other (except where prohibited under the Terms of Use). But you should NOT spend your days directly soliciting other members. It’s just annoying and may result in cancellation of your membership. 

2.	Circuit Launch is, first and foremost, a place to work. While we want our community to be: a) open, fun, and collaborative, we also want it to be b) professional. You are responsible for properly balancing a) and b). 

3.	Every person using the Circuit Launch Facilities MUST be a paid member. Exceptions: non-members can use our facility if they are meeting Circuit Launch members for business-related meetings, or if the non-members have purchased a Day Pass or are participating in a Circuit Launch sanctioned activity. You are absolutely accountable for the conduct of your guests. 

4.	Circuit Launch access keys (digital & physical) are NOT transferable. Please do not give your key / access to anyone else for any reason. 

5.	We expect everyone to keep the kitchen area clean. Please do your dishes by either putting them in the dishwasher or hand-washing them and putting them in the dish rack. Please do your guests' dishes. The staff at Circuit Launch (and your fellow members) will get really, really grumpy if you leave your dirty dishes lying around. 

6.	The refrigerator is primarily for storing that day’s food, beverages, and some occasional leftovers from events. As a general policy, food that is older than one week and taking up space will be thrown out. Containers or food left in the refrigerator may be thrown out at any time at the discretion of the facility manager. Labeling your food will help us at least give you a heads up.
7.	Caffeine is a lifeblood of Circuit Launch. If you drink the last cup of coffee, please make a new pot. The easiest way to rankle your fellow caffeine-addicted members is to leave 0.42% of a cup at the bottom of the pot. Don't be that guy or gal. 

8.	Access to conference rooms is another great benefit of Circuit Launch membership. Here’s some stuff regarding conference rooms: 

[a] If you want to use a conference room, you must reserve it. Please, no conference room squatting. Exception: when not reserved, the room(s) may be used as a general coworking space. Please make sure you are out of the room at least 2 hours before any reserved time block, and make sure the room is clean/put together when you leave it.
[b] Conference rooms are for meetings with customers, teammates, and clients ONLY. If you want to hold an event at Circuit Launch in one of our conference rooms or classrooms, please talk to the friendly Circuit Launch staff to discuss scheduling, guest policies, and fees. 

[c] You may not re-sell or donate your conference room time to non-members or outside groups. 

[d] Please clean up after using a conference room. If you re-arrange the furniture in the conference room, we expect that you will return it to the original set-up when you’re finished. 

9.	Common areas are shared workspaces. Here’s how we can all happily and productively share these spaces together: 
[a] The main space is for more open, collaborative work while the other common areas are for quieter, more focused work. 

[b] Please make phone calls in the lounge areas. Speaker phones are never allowed at Circuit Launch, except when in a private office, conference room or classroom. 

[c] Please occupy only one spot at a time in the common area. Taking up multiple spots limits the space available to your fellow members. Don’t be that guy or gal. 
[d] “The One Hour Rule”: Feel free to leave your stuff in the and common areas. But if you’ll be gone for longer than an hour, please pack your stuff up so your spot is available to for another member. 

10.	We cannot allow dogs or pets (except service animals) at Circuit Launch. 

11.	Circuit Launch is a 24/7 facility for private desk members. You don’t have to go home, but you can’t live here. We expect members to be mindful of security at all times. NEVER go out the back doors unless it’s an emergency. The back doors are not there as a short cut!
12.	Circuit Launch is a smoke-free facility. Please smoke outside at least 100 feet away from windows and doors. And NEVER go out the back door to smoke. 

13.	Feel free to invite friends or guests for lunch, a quick meeting, or just to say hello. However, if your guest is going to be here for more than an hour we would ask that they pay for a daily pass. Guests are required to adhere to all Circuit Launch Agreements, including the Membership Agreement, Terms of Use, Liability Release, and this Community Code.
14.	Every Guest MUST sign a Liability Release.
15.	The doors are automatically locked most of the time. We have large windows that look in on our members’ gear and our supplies. Do not do anything to cause the doors to be unlocked for any notable length of time. If you believe the doors are not locked when you leave the space, it is your duty to notify Circuit Launch Staff of the situation, so we can fix the problem.
16.	Most of the desks in the Common Areas are for the community. Unless you are paying for a permanent desk, please do not leave property on the desks or around the desks when you will not be working there that day. Take home what you bring in, or arrange with the co-founders for storage in an out-of-the-way area. Every evening and/or morning the desks will be cleared of items, which will be deposited in an area for collection. 
17.	Heat & air conditioning. We set the heat and air conditioning on a schedule that makes sense for most people. Please do not raise or lower the temperature more than 3 degrees. If the heat or air conditioning do not seem to be working, please notify Circuit Launch Staff.
18.	Circuit Launch values responsible recycling in all possible forms. This includes disposing of refuse that could present dangers through the contamination and pollution of the environment. These forms of hazardous waste require special disposal techniques to make them harmless or less dangerous. Circuit Launch has requested appropriate recycling totes from the City of Oakland, in order that member might dispose of refuse responsibly. This policy herein mandates that refuse in question be disposed of accordingly; this includes items that may pose a threat to human health or the environment. Such items should not be thrown away with general municipal waste (e.g. printer cartridges, certain batteries, CFL bulbs, etc). Do your best to dispose of such waste accordingly, and when in doubt, check with Circuit Launch Staff.
19.	Indoor voice. We are all trying to get work done, so try to be mindful and respectful of others’ attention and time. Generally, if someone has their headphones on, please respect their privacy (that’s the most important rule we have). Circuit Launch is not a library, and collaboration is encouraged, but this is a workplace, first and foremost.
20.	Alcohol. We do not tolerate intoxication at Circuit Launch.
21.	Changes. We will do our best to notify members of changes to the Community Code. We will strive to keep an up-to-date copy of this Code on Circuit Launch’s website.
22.	You acknowledge that during your membership at Circuit Launch, you are going to be exposed to Circuit Launch Confidences. “Circuit Launch Confidences” means information (such as business information, trade secrets, technology, customers and prospects, and other secret stuff) disclosed by Circuit Launch or by other (including knowledge gained through your keen observation) that is confidential or proprietary in nature and simply just not known by others. It’s plain and simple - you agree to keep confidential and not to disclose or use Circuit Launch Confidences, you understand that they remain the exclusive property of whomever disclosed them, and you don’t acquire any rights to such Circuit Launch Confidences.
23.	Phone calls. If you have a phone call and it will last just a minute or two, feel free to take it in the common areas. If you are going to be on the phone for more than that, please use the phone rooms (or phone booth, if you’re feeling old-time-y). We paid to have them installed so that you and our fellow members could have some privacy and avoid the mental oddity for others of hearing half of a conversation.
Some exceptions can be made, such as for those working in support jobs, where an occasional and not very talkative phone call of 5-10 minutes is necessary. We ask, however, that you keep your voice quiet, and, if you know that a call will persist for more than 5 minutes or be especially talkative, you take the call into a phone room.
24.	Circuit Launch is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of people at our events or space in any form. People violating these rules may be put on notice by any member; and sanctioned or expelled from the space or the event at the discretion of the Circuit Launch Staff.
Harassment includes:
Offensive verbal comments
Sexual images in public spaces
Deliberate intimidation
Stalking
Following
Photography or recording without consent
Sustained disruption of talks or other events
Inappropriate physical contact
Unwelcome sexual attention
People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Any behavior or action experienced as harassment will be responded to as such.
25.	Finally, we have a great staff at Circuit Launch, if we don’t say so ourselves. Our job is to manage this fantastically innovative community. Got questions, ideas, or suggestions? Need help connecting, catalyzing, and creating? Just want to chat about your latest scheme to save the universe? Interacting with our members is the best part of our job. And thanks to you, it’s a pretty damn cool job, indeed!
