# Code of Conduct


## Scope

This policy applies to all employees of Lumenora, and is expected of representatives in any form including all Lumenora communities online (including but not limited to support chat, online forums, the Lumenora Community Slack group, Twitter, and Facebook), in the Lumenora office, and at all events hosted by Lumenora.

## Expectations 

Our community is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, color, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation as well as gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, computing experience, or clothing. Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.

We reserve the right to determine the appropriate level of disciplinary action for disruptive and/or inappropriate conduct. Disciplinary action can include written or verbal warnings, suspension with or without pay, and discharge. Each situation will be dealt with on an individual basis.

## Zero Tolerance Policy 

We do not tolerate harassment, fighting, bullying, coercion or use of abusive or threatening words directed to, about or against a co-worker, lead, manager, executive, applicant, client/customer, vendor or community member of any kind.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to the protected classes above, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed.  

Bullying includes repeated, health-harming, and productivity-harming mistreatment of one or more persons by one or more perpetrators. This can include but is not limited to conduct that is abusive, threatening, humiliating, intimidating and interferes with, prevents, sabbotages, undermines and/or is used to leverages against another's ability to do work, as well as abuse that is verbal, physical, psychological, emotional, of intellectual or physical property or other or form of abuse. Bullying often takes place when the perpetrator has a need to control targed individuals, and can include the attempt to undermine legitimate business interests in which the perputrator's personal agenda takes presedence over work itself, the company's objectives and/or best interests. 

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstance.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Community members violating these rules may be sanctioned or removed from community spaces. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Rose or Krista immediately.

Examples of behavior that may result in disciplinary action, including possible termination, are:
- reporting to work ill-equipped or willfully unable to perform your duties as scheduled
- treating others in a discourteous manner
- threatening or intimidating others
- using abusive language
- racist, sexist, or homophobic behavior 
- sexual or any other form of harassment
- reporting for work under the influence of alcohol/drugs
- violation of company policies or directives
- refusal to follow instructions concerning an employment or contract-related directive
- misuse of company time and/or resources
- failure to meet job performance standards


## Retaliation 

Retaliation of any sort for filing a claim of harassment, fighting, bullying, coercion or abuse of power will not be tolerated. If you believe you have been retaliated against, please contact the HR department to initiate an investigation.
